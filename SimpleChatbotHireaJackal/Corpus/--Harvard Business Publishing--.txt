The company consists of three market groups: Higher Education, Corporate Learning, and Harvard Business Review Group. It produces print and digital products including Harvard Business Review, Harvard Business Review Press Books, and case briefs, blogs, events and seminars, as well as a variety of online courses such as Harvard ManageMentor and Leadership Direct, frequently used by Harvard Business School and other Business Schools.

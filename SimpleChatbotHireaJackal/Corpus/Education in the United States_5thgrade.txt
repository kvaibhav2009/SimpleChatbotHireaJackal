Fifth grade (called Grade 5 in some regions) is a year of education in many nations. The fifth grade is the fifth and last school year of elementary school in most schools. It depends on the school district, the grade may be the second to last or last year of elementary school, the first year of middle school or the first year of intermediate school. Students are usually 10-11 years old unless the child has been held back. In England and Wales, the equivalent is Year 6. In Ireland the equivalent is 5th class.

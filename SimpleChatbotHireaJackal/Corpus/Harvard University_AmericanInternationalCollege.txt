American International College (AIC) is a private, co-educational liberal arts college located in the Mason Square neighborhood of Springfield, Massachusetts.


== History ==
American International College was originally established on July 18, 1885, as the French Protestant College by Rev. Calvin E. Amaron, who sought to create an institution of higher learning that would provide the local French Protestant minority with access to higher education. Over the years the college expanded its admissions program to include women, in 1892—the first New England college to do so—as well as minorities who were not of French origin and had immigrated to Western Massachusetts from other parts of Europe and Canada.


== Academics ==
The college offers undergraduate and graduate programs, including master's and doctoral degrees and certificates of advanced graduate study (CAGS). There are three schools which focus on their respective academic areas: the School of Business, Arts, and Sciences; the School of Health Sciences; and the School of Graduate and Adult Education.

The eleventh grade is the last year in secondary education. In this year, all students are required to do an internship in any subject field. To differentiate from Universities' internships, the practice is called 'alphabetisation'; most of the time is related to community services, such as teaching in schools, or assisting in hospitals or libraries. Students also do the ICFES National Test and they present to the draft for the Colombian Army. By law, the army cannot recruit under-age students; most of eleventh-graders are aged 16-17, and the draft is almost changed for the payment of a monetary fee. This year is called the senior year.

== Hong Kong ==
In Hong Kong, 11th grade is called Form 5.


== India ==
In India, after appearing for the boards, the percentages determine the streams in which the student can study.
There are three streams:
Science, which comprises Physics, Chemistry, Biology, English, Computer Science/Informatics/Physical Education/Maths/Psychology/Home Science,
Commerce, which comprises Accountancy, Marketing, English, Business Studies, Business Economics, Informatics /Maths/Physical Education,
Humanities/Arts which comprises English, Psychology, Fashion Studies/Home science, Informatics.
The combination of streams can vary from Institutions.
But in abroad places, the streams are determined by the model exam, which is under the school. The stream which the students opt for are the basis of which degree they can study. Generally eleventh grade is known as +1 which originates from the term 10+1. This year is generally the continuation of grade 9 and grade 12 is the continuation of grade 10.

=== England and Wales ===

Year 12, or Lower Sixth form, is comparable to the 11th grade in the US. It is the sixth and penultimate year of secondary education. For students who entered secondary school before September 2008, it is not compulsory to attend these last two years. During Year 12, three Advanced Subsidiary units are completed per subject (either written exams, coursework or a mixture, depending on subject). Often students choose four AS-Level subjects in Year 12 (some students may decide to take three or five).
Students then enter Year 13 (equivalent to 12th grade) and may choose to drop a subject, going on to complete three subjects. Successful completion generally results in the award of A-Level qualifications, though BTECs can be received.


=== Scotland ===
In Scotland, fifth year (of secondary education) or S5 is optional, where pupils will generally sit Higher qualifications which form the core entry requirements for university. It is followed by an optional final sixth year (also known as S6). The students ages normally range from 16-17 in this year.


=== Northern Ireland ===
The system is similar to the English one at this age. Lower Sixth Form (Year 13), pupils start on a two-year course, at the end of which they will hopefully have gained three 'A' Levels in their chosen subjects.


== United States ==
In the US, a student in the eleventh grade is typically referred to as a junior. Juniors (JGA) are the third year class of high school. Many students take the SAT Reasoning Test and/or ACT in the second half of their third year of high school.
Math students usually take Algebra II, but classes like Trigonometry or Pre-Calculus are sometimes offered for students who wish to take Advanced Placement math classes in their fourth year of high school. Depending on the location there may be a combination of any of the listed subjects. They may also take easier courses such as Algebra I and Geometry if they do not have the required prerequisites for the more advanced courses that are listed above. Students who are advanced in mathematics often take Calculus or Statistics.
In science classes, third year students are taught usually Biology, or Chemistry especially Lab Chemistry. Atoms, molecules, and Stoichiometry is taught as well.
In English class, a college-preparatory curriculum would also include American literature. Often, English literature (also referred to as British literature) is taught in the third year of high school. Books and authors learned include The Glass Menagerie, The Scarlet Letter, The Crucible, The Great Gatsby, Of Mice and Men, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, The Grapes of Wrath, Jonathan Edwards, Amy Tan, and Lorraine Hansberry.
In a social studies curriculum, third year students in the United States are usually taught US history or the world from the 1870s to the 21st Century. They may also acquire more advanced world culture and geography knowledge, along with some more-advanced social studies such as psychology and government.
Many high school third year students in the United States opt to take a foreign language, even though it is not required in many secondary schools curricula.
While normally followed by twelfth grade, some colleges will accept excelling students out of this grade as part of an early college entrance program. Alternatively, some students may choose to graduate early through standardized testing or advanced credits.

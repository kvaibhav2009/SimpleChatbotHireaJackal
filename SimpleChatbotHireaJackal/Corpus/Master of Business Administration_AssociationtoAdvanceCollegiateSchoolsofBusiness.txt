The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business, also known as AACSB International, is an American professional organization. It was founded in 1916 to provide accreditation to schools of business. It was formerly known as the American Association of Collegiate Schools of Business and as the International Association for Management Education. Not all members of the association are accredited; it does not accredit for-profit schools. In 2016 it lost recognition by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation.


== History ==
The American Association of Collegiate Schools of Business was founded as an accrediting body in 1916 by a group of seventeen American universities and colleges. The first accreditations took place in 1919. For many years the association accredited only American business schools, but in the latter part of the twentieth century it advocated a more international approach to business education. The first school it accredited outside the United States was the University of Alberta in 1968, and the first outside North America was the French business school ESSEC, in 1997.
Robert S. Sullivan, dean of Rady School of Management, became chair of the association in 2013.
The association struggled with its Council for Higher Education Accreditation recognition in 2016. At a board meeting on January 26, 2015, the council deferred recognition pending satisfaction of its policy requirements. The association withdrew from CHEA recognition on September 23, 2016.

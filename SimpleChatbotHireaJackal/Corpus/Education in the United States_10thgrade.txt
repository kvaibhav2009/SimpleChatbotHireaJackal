People don't usually call the steps of the Danish gymnasium for 10th, 11th or 12th grade, but usually refer to them as 1st G, 2nd G, and 3rd G. Here, G is simply the letter "G", and it refers to the three different steps of the education.

== Sweden ==
In Sweden, the tenth to twelfth grades are taken at a certain type of school called a 'Gymnasium'. After ninth grade, Swedish children end their compulsory schooling. Therefore, these schools are significantly divided in terms of both abilities and career aims. There are two overall types of programs (courses of study) that students can choose from at their schools. Each one is taught in its own separate place. Job-oriented programs (yrkesförberedande program) and programs that prepare for university college (högskoleförberedande program). There are then several programmes of the two types; for example the natural science program (naturvetenskapsprogrammet), which prepares for university college and focuses on subjects like physics, chemistry, biology and math or the construction programme (bygg och anläggningsprogrammet), which is a programme specialized for jobs in that sector. Other options among college preparatory program are for instance the social science program, specializing in social studies and subjects like civics, sociology, psychology, language and history.
For these higher schools students can pick a school that is specialized for the job they wish to take (yrkesförberedande gymnasium). At these schools only classes relevant to the classification of the school are taught, along with language, math and some civics skills. There are widely oriented schools such as General Arts, but also very specific schools, such as Equestrian.
Students that do not yet have any specific career aspirations, or wish to go to a school specialized for a profession that requires a gymnasial degree, can choose to move into a general school, which has programmes preparing for college university (högskoleförberedande program). The system there is very similar to the system from seventh grade to ninth grade except that the student has chosen a program which allows the student to focus on an (albeit in a somewhat general way) area of interest. For instance; the economics programme (ekonomiprogrammet) includes courses in business economics, entrepreneurship and other such courses along with general courses that all students going to schools which prepare for university college must take, such as math, language, civics, physical education etc.
